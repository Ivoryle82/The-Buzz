## User Stories for mobile branch and Unit Tests
Mobile Branch
Unit Tests
User upvote and downvote
Unit Test: Test if a user can upvote a post. 
Automated:Write a test script to verify that count corresponds to the number of votes 
Manual: 
Click on the "upvote" button.

Admin User Stories and Unit Tests
1. As an admin user, I want to manage the content of the App so that things that shouldnâ€™t be available are made invalid to unauthorized users.
   - Unit test: Check that invalidation works within the valid/invalid field. Verify that the unauthorized user is denied access and that the content remains accessible to authorized admin users.

2. As an admin user, I want to view the details of a message or file, including who uploaded it and when it was last updated, to understand its relevance.
   - Unit Test: Check that correct content information is retrieved. Verify that the information displayed matches the actual content details.

3. As an admin user, I want to have a feature to manage storage, allowing me to delete least accessed documents easily.
   - Unit Test: Check that infrequently used uploaded content can be deleted. Confirm that documents marked as least accessed are deleted and that frequently accessed documents remain untouched.

## Backlog

    Evan (Mobile):
- Get oauth to work so that i can use the google drive scope.
-> also after oauth works switch from devsession to mobile login route to get the session key
    -> cache the session key
- figure out what is going wrong with converting images to base64.
  Then, pass that string in the add message request
- test link parsing and make sure that works

    Sam (Web):
- caching

## General questions

1. What required Phase 3 functionality still has not been implemented or is not operating properly and why?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * List this based on a component-by-component basis, as appropriate.
    * Caching in the web branch still hasn't been implemented. 
    * converting images to base64 for the mobile branch

2. What technical debt remains?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * List this based on a component-by-component basis, as appropriate.
    * caching for the web and mobile branches. 
    * for mobile branch, getting oauth to work and converting images to base64. 

3. If there was any remaining Phase 3 functionality that needed to be implemented in Phase 3', what did the PM do to assist in the effort of getting this functionality implemented and operating properly?

    * I assisted in trying to help wth suggesting different solutions to fix the internal server issues and merge conflicts

4. Describe how the team worked together in Phase 3'. Were all members engaged? Was the work started early in the week or was there significant procrastination?
    * The work started early in the week, though due to our conflicting schedules, we had to work asynchronously 

5. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next Phase (if there were one)?
    * I would suggest trying to meet and work more synchronously in person.

## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    - during monday recitation for about an hour.

2. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * It had too little detail, it could use more details of what exactly needed to be completed and when. I did not implement any policies around its use.

3. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    - I conducted team meetings in person in FML for a few hours and we discussed what steps we needed to take next. Since this was the switch off phase, we were telling each other how to work with our previous ends. Outside of these meetings we interact well and are friendly towards each other. 

4. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    - We used Jira board to mitigate risk and lable the risk levels of each of the assignements. 

5. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    - There were no issues between any individuals. We just had an issue with merge conflicts that we were working together to resolve. 

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    - Our most significant obstacle this is sprint was time. We did not have enough time in our schedules to film one video together. 

7. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    - My biggest concern for the next sprint is getting all of ends to pass their tests. 

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    - I underestimated how short this sprint was and was initially overwhelmed. However, I have a better grasp on the time it will take to complete each task. 

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    - There are no aspects of the project that would cause concern for the customer at the moment.
