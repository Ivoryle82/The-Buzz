## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
> We met on monday night and wednesday for 4-5 ish hours in total
2. How did you conduct team meetings? How did your team interact outside of these meetings? Highlight any changes from last week.
> We meet during class time and at the citl in FML. We picked a mutal time and date that would work for everyone
3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
> Checked slack often  this was a very short sprint this week so there wasnt a lot to manage, we just plugged it all out together on wednesday.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?
> I had practice so I couldnt stay for the entirity of our meeting but other than that we are solving and problems together as a team. Though we still have some coding errors in different branches we are slowing working through them

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
> Cathcing up on our technical debt. We have our backend umpleneted but we are still having issues in our admin class. Once we work through these issues we will be set and hopefully catch up.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
> probably technical debt. We had issues with getting our backend up early and needed much assistance from the mentors which slowed down testing for everyone. This prevented us from further finding errors in code that we beleived to be correct but couldnt implement correctly. 
7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
> We should start catching up on our debt
> stop putting things off
> continue submitting everything on time

8. Is there anything you wish to add?
> Its a pleasure working with this team
